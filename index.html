subtitle: Post-doctoral Researcher, Northwestern University

<p>I'm a post-doctoral researcher at Northwestern University. My research interests include quantitative genetics, population genetics, genomics, and molecular ecology. I've been working for the past few years with the lovable <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, a small free-living nematode species that's been central to no less than six Noble prizes! My research is focused on understanding how evolution has shaped the patterns of natural genetic diversity in the species and dissecting the roles that specific genetic variants play in influencing fitness related traits.
